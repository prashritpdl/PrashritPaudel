        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Prashrit, currently enrolled at Mohawk College since 2023. Over the past summer, I gained practical experience as a volunteering IT Support at Multi-Cane Vision Inc.
             Additionally, I've been juggling part-time responsibilities as a cashier at Al Premium SuperStore since the beginning of my studies. My expertise lies in Web Development, Data Management, and Server Administration, encompassing various operating systems such as Windows, Linux, and Microsoft Server. Proficient in Microsoft Office and well-versed in networking protocols like TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP, and server management, I bring a comprehensive skill set to the table. Furthermore, I possess foundational knowledge in programming languages like Python and Java. 
            On the softer side, my interpersonal skills, problem-solving abilities, and adaptability make me a valuable asset to any team.</p>
